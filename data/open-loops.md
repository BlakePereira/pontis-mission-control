# Open Loops

*Promises, pending items, follow-ups. Anything that would be embarrassing to forget.*

## How to use
- Add items as they arise.
- Close them explicitly with a date + note.
- Keep this short and actionable.

---

## Pontis
- [ ] Confirm final fix for **staging OTP mismatch** (prefer Supabase auth config alignment; avoid UI divergence).
- [ ] Complete **hardcoded values audit** (PONTIS-HC-001).
- [ ] Decide on **geolocation activation** approach (loosen/skip/manual/offline + timeout behavior).
- [ ] Address **elderly activation UX** assumptions (email/smartphone) with fallbacks.
- [ ] Verify **staging cron jobs** remain pointed to staging + `dryRun` where appropriate.
- [ ] Ensure any previously-exposed production keys are rotated (historical: `.env.staging` leak risk).
- [ ] Staging functionality test sweep (core flows + maps + admin).

## Blake (personal)
- [ ] Healthcare.gov / Marketplace call to fix **APTC = $0** subsidy issue; request retroactive adjustment/refund.
- [ ] Maintain scripture study cadence; keep tracker updated.
- [ ] Dating goal: ask someone out ~1x/week (output-based).
